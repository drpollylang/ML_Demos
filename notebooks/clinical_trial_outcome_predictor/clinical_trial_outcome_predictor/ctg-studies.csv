If it gets worse, intestines can slip into the bulge, leading to serious pain and health problems. This study aims to asses if AGN-151607-DP is safe and effective for closing the belly wall after open ventral hernia surgery, without needing a complex procedure. Adverse Events and change in disease activity will be assessed.

AGN-151607-DP is an investigational drug being developed to treat ventral hernia. Participants will be randomly placed in treatment groups to receive either AGN151607-DP or matching placebo. Approximately 200 adult participants with midline ventral hernia needing open surgical repair will be enrolled in approximately 30 sites in the United States.

Participants will receive intramuscular injections of AGN-161607-DP or matching placebo on Day 1. Duration of the study is approximately 25 months.

Despite widespread use of multimodal regimens, many patients still rely on opioids, which can cause sedation, nausea, constipation, and long-term dependency. Evaluating Suzetrigine in this high-need population may improve recovery trajectories, reduce opioid consumption, and support enhanced recovery protocols. Given the growing surgical volume and the emphasis on opioid-sparing strategies, rigorous investigation of Suzetrigine's efficacy in joint replacement is of high clinical value.
